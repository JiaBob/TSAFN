# TSAFN
Texture and Structure Awareness Network

This network contains three sub-models, which are TPN, SPN and TSAFN. Corresponding paper is

In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) (pp. 217-233).](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Kaiyue_Lu_Deep_Texture_and_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf)

The so-called SPN is same as HED which comes from paper:
